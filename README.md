	This project is the preliminary project before the final project 
for the module H61RTS Introduction to real time system.

	The objective of the project is to implement a game of repeatance 
on the micro-controller pic18f87j11. The usr would be asked to repeat the
paradime displayed on the LCD screen on the pic18f based demo-board by the 
two onboard buttons, the initial length of the paradime is 3 bits, each
successful repeatance of the sequence would cause the paradime to increase
by 1 bit, the player will win the game when the length of the paradime exceeds
30.
